# latent-class-model
 Latent Class Model for labelling astronomical images

In this example we have a table with columns: transientid, volunteer_1... volunteer_10 as seen in the Figure below. The aim is to provide a final label to each transientid/candidate based on the volunteers labelling using Latent Class Model, instead of just assigning a label based on this criteria:
    h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x) = &theta;<sub>o</sub> x + &theta;<sub>1</sub>x
.
